## TradFi rigor × DeFi execution

I’m **Nicolas Macé**, a Paris-born finance engineer with **4 years in Investment Banking** (derivatives / fixed income / FX support & risk monitoring) and **4 years building DeFi conviction through real capital**.

My focus: **bring “risk desk discipline” to on-chain strategies** — especially **lending/borrowing** and **CLMM LPing (market making)**.

<div class="notice--info">
  <strong>What I’m building:</strong> a practical DeFi Risk Monitoring Toolkit to track exposures, position health, and net performance over time.

## Why this matters (DeFi ≠ “yield farming”)

Many dashboards show *positions*. Few show **risk**.

This toolkit answers, at a glance:
- **What can hurt me today?** (liquidation distance, out-of-range risk, concentration)
- **What is working?** (fees vs IL, carry vs price move, true net return)
- **What should I do next?** (actionable alerts + prioritized actions)

---

## My background in 20 seconds

### TradFi (Institutional discipline)
- Real-time trading support and incident investigation in high-stakes environments  
- PnL/risk monitoring habits: **proactivity, escalation, and precision**
- Exposure to **derivatives, fixed income, and FX** workflows

### DeFi (On-chain execution)
- Lending/borrowing strategies (Aave-style risk management)
- CLMM LPing as **market making**: inventory risk, price range risk, fee volatility
- Building dashboards + automation to monitor positions and exposure

---

## Current focus

- **Risk Overview**: LTV monitoring, liquidation buffers, protocol/token concentration
- **Performance**: fees – IL – funding – borrow cost, tracked over time
- **Positions**: in-range state, distance-to-bounds, inventory drift, rebalance workflow

<div class="notice--success">
  <strong>Design rule:</strong> every metric must lead to a decision: <em>hold / rebalance / deleverage / exit / add</em>.
